# pbkdf2

PBKDF2 takes a passphrase and a salt and returns a requested number, dkLen, of key bytes.  It generates the key bytes by repeatedly calling an internal function, f, until it has concatenated together enough blocks to return the requested number of key bytes. The function f recursively calls a pseudorandom function a requested number of iterations to produce a block of bytes to add to the key. The pseudorandom function is usually (and by default) an HMAC based on a hash function, such as specified in FIPS-NIST-198.

The PBKDF2 algorithm is described in detail in IETF RFC 8018.

## R/Basic

This is the R programming 101 version.  A call to the PBKDF2 function computes and returns the requested number of key bytes.  This is an advantage if only a small number of key bytes are required, as in the usual case of generating one key to encrypt some data.  It may be a disadvantage if a large number of key bytes are needed, as when a set of keys are to be generated from the same password.

## R/R6

This the R6 OOP version. The PBDKF2_READER class is instantiated with the password, salt, number of iterations, and HMAC function to be used in the algorithm.  The read(count) method generates enough blocks to return the requested number of expanded key bytes.  If the count is not a multiple of the underlying block size (the hash length), then read(count) saves the leftover bytes.  Additional calls to read(count) return subsequent bytes from the sequence defined by the parameters, beginning with any leftover bytes, as if reading from a stream.  The close() method makes the remainder of the expanded key bytes inaccesible, so further calls to read(count) will throw an error.  The close() method also resets the internal variables to remove references to the parameters and any leftover state.

## Unit Tests

In PBKDF2, the actual calculations that map a passphrase and salt to key bytes are carried out in the pseudorandom function, either one specified as an argument, or the default hmac with algorithm sha-256 in the r digest package.  The unit tests verify that the pseudorandom function is called correctly and that the resulting key bytes are assembled and selected correctly to provide the result. The unit tests rely primarily on published test vectors, but can also rely on the results of direct calls to the specified pseudorandom function for some simple cases, such as when the test specifies just one iteration.

The unit tests check usage with MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-384, SHA-256, and SHA-512.  SHA-256 is tested using the default pseudorandom function. Iterations as large as 80,000 are tested.  Some tests are built into the unit test source, but many (from Anti-weakpasswords) are specified in .csv files, which makes it easy to add tests to meet unique requirements.
